# Hardware platforms
## HoloOcean Requirements
- To utilize the HoloOcean underwater simulator effectively, you'll need access to a computer equipped with a strong GPU. This requirement arises from the simulator's foundation on Unreal Engine 4, a graphics-intensive platform that demands substantial graphical processing power. If your current computer lacks a robust GPU, fear not—alternative options exist. Consider leveraging the BU SCC (Boston University Shared Computing Cluster), a computer cluster optimized for cloud computation. Through Secure Shell (SSH) technology, you can remotely access the cluster's resources, potentially including GPUs tailored for graphical rendering tasks. However, keep in mind that GPU availability may vary, necessitating an application process for access to dedicated GPU resources. By navigating these options, you can ensure a seamless experience with the HoloOcean simulator, unlocking its full potential for underwater exploration and simulation.
  
## Initial 2D SLAM & sonar_SLAM & Bruce_SLAM implementation Requirements
- For the Initial 2D SLAM, sonar_SLAM, and Bruce SLAM implementations, the hardware requirements are far more accessible. Any computer equipped with Python—a widely used programming language—suffices for running these algorithms. However, it's crucial to adhere to the dependency specifications outlined in the accompanying readme.md file. By installing the requisite dependencies, you ensure compatibility and functionality across different systems. Whether you're using a personal laptop, a desktop workstation, or a cloud-based computing environment, these SLAM implementations offer versatility and ease of integration into your underwater robotics projects. Simply follow the setup instructions, and you'll be ready to embark on your journey of underwater mapping and navigation with confidence.
