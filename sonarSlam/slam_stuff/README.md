`make_graph.py` (in progress): This eventually would work to create a graph that can be solved using methods from the g2o library. Currently, functions in this file work to link known landmarks from our landmark detection process with specific datapoints. 

`notes.txt`: General outline of how we intend to complete this

Other files: Moslty scrap/old test files that may be useful down the line
