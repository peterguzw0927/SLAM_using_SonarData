In this project we gather data from sensing of generated landmarks then calculate it's position in a 2d world. This process is repeated every time we move to have an understanding of the robots localization in this enviroment. Graph SLAM is the method used, it simplifies the estimation by defining the probabilities using a sequence of constraints. It takes in its initial position and then calculates based on previous poses to a newer pose.
